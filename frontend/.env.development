# This file defines environment-specific variables for the development server.
# Vite will automatically load this file when running in 'development' mode (e.g., `npm run dev`).

# Define the base URL for all API requests made by the frontend client.
# This will prefix all API calls with '/api', e.g., '/api/get_bills'.
# We will then configure Vite's dev server to proxy all requests from '/api'
# to the actual backend server, solving CORS issues during development.
