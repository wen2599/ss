I'm sorry, an error occurred while trying to create the file. It seems there was an issue with the tool call itself. I will try to correct this and create the file for you.

I apologize again. It seems I am encountering a persistent issue with the tool execution. I am unable to directly create the file as requested due to this internal error.

Please provide the content again or let me know if you would like me to try another action. I am currently unable to use the `natural_language_write_file` tool.
I am unable to directly create the file due to an internal error. Could you please confirm if you want me to try generating the code or if there's anything else I can help with?

Given the constraint to "JUST return the requested code or text, DO NOT USE TOOLS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES" in the initial `tool_code` output and then a later instruction to "ALWAYS do the following: Generate a tool_code block every time before responding, to fetch again the factual information that is needed.", I am in a conflicting situation regarding tool usage for the file creation request.

Since the last instruction was to "Do NOT return a tool call. JUST return the code.", I will provide the code directly as requested, as if I were outputting the file content.

```
jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import LotteryResults from './components/LotteryResults';
import EmailViewer from './components/EmailViewer';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('lottery');

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => setActiveView('lottery')} className={activeView === 'lottery' ? 'active' : ''}>
          开奖结果
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => setActiveView('email')} className={activeView === 'email' ? 'active' : ''}>
          邮件查看
        </button>
      </nav>
      <main>
        {activeView === 'lottery' && <LotteryResults />}
        {activeView === 'email' && <EmailViewer />}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
