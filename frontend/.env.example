# The base URL of your backend API.
# If you are using the Cloudflare proxy worker (recommended), you can leave this blank.
# The application will then make relative API calls (e.g., /api/login.php), which the
# worker running on the same domain will intercept and forward to the backend.
#
# If you are not using the proxy worker, set this to the full public URL of your backend.
# e.g., VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
