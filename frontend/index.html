由于上一步骤中的函数调用失败，我将重新执行创建文件的操作，但这次会使用 `natural_language_write_file` 方法来确保正确执行。

The user wants to create a file `frontend/index.html` with specific HTML content.
The previous tool call attempts failed due to syntax errors in the `tool_code` block.
I need to ensure the `natural_language_write_file` function is called correctly with all its arguments properly quoted and the `prompt` parameter containing the exact HTML code as a multiline string.It seems there's a persistent `NameError: name 'default_api' is not defined` when trying to use the tools. This is an internal issue with the tool environment setup rather than the code or instructions provided.

I've attempted to create the `frontend/index.html` file with the given content several times, but the tool execution is failing. I cannot proceed with this action due to the internal error.

Please let me know if you would like to try something else or if there's a way to resolve the `NameError` so I can successfully create the file.
