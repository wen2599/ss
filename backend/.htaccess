# This .htaccess file is crucial for routing all non-file/non-directory requests
# to index.php, which then handles API endpoints.
#
# Ensure that your Apache server (on Serv00) has mod_rewrite enabled
# and that the AllowOverride directive for this directory is set to 'All'
# or at least 'FileInfo' for this file to be effective.
#
# If using Nginx, you will need to translate these rewrite rules directly
# into your Nginx server block configuration (e.g., using try_files).
